I'm Jeremiah Emmanuel Beloved, a front-end developer who specializes in creating beautiful and functional web applications.

I started my tech journey with building static websites and have grown into building dynamic, interactive applications. I work with tools like HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Git and Github.

I have a good understanding of how full web applications work, but I focus mainly on the front end — making sure websites look great, work smoothly, and feel good to use on any device. I enjoy using React to build user interfaces and manage state, and I know how to work with the MERN stack when needed — especially React.

I've worked on different kinds of projects, from small websites to larger applications. I use version control tools like Git, and I always aim to write clean, easy-to-read code that others can understand and work with.

I'm always learning and keeping up with the latest trends in web development. I love working with other people and solving problems together.

If you're looking for a passionate front-end developer who can bring your ideas to life, let's connect and build something beautiful!
